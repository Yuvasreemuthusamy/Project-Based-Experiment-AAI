    "Great job on the update!",
    "The product quality is poor. I won't be buying again.",
    
]

# Perform sentiment analysis and filter for negative feedback
negative_feedback = []

for message in facebook_data:
    sentiment_score = sia.polarity_scores(message)['compound']
    if sentiment_score < 0:  # Negative sentiment
        negative_feedback.append(message)

# Print the negative feedback
print("Negative Feedback:")
for feedback in negative_feedback:
    print(feedback)
